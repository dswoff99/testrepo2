#### Data Goals & Experience

>I research and provide insights in support of internal developmet projects, sales proposals, and campaign delivery optimization.I perform crosstab analysis with 3rd party research database tools, as well as produce my own data sources through research efforts such as surveys and custom tracking.  I work extensively in Google Analytics, comScore, MRI, and more.  I also have a fairly extensive coding background, and have been able to automate a large chunk of my daily and weekly responsiblities.  


#### Why I signed up??

>I was referred to General Assembly by a number of friends and colleagues; however, most recently, I was advised to take the data science course by a recent student, who thought it would benefit my current job hunt.


#### Something Interesting

>Outside of work and school, my primary hobby/interest is in DIY Tech and hacking.  Currently I work with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis, focusing on LED matrices and configurations.  While my link is not wholly data\-oriented, there are alot of data\-specific concepts involved with what I do.  LEDs are often configured in a such a way, and colors manipulated in such a way, that the data collection, management, and manipulation methods and guidelines are very relevant.  Additionally, much of the software I work with or produce is writtnen in Python, and this class is helping me better understand the code environment, and math\-related plugins that will ultimately make my outside projects significantly easier!
